# Atlas is a starter theme for Drupal 8

This starter theme is a companion to a [series of articles](https://www.lullabot.com/blog/article/drupal-8-theming-fundamentals-part-1) on Lullabot.com.

Some of the examples from the articles have been modified slightly to provide more sensible defaults for those who would like to use Atlas as a starting point for their own work.

In coming days a simple Gulp workflow will be added that will support [Libsass](https://github.com/sass/libsass) as well other commonly used tools and processes.
